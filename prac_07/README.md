# Practical 07

## This repository stores all practical 7's programming files (by Aurelia Jeffrina)

### 3 main lessons I learned about "clear code" in this subject
- The naming convention for class file name is the exact same name as the class name in lowercase
- Method names with leading underscores/dunder is called non-public attributes, while method names without dunder is called public attributes
- Always define __str__ method to return string in the client file and print as it is formatted in the class file
