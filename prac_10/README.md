# Practical 10
# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I'd say 65-70% accurate, some of my codes took a really long time to finish because 
I still need to digest the function on each programs and I tried to fully understand it. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It hasn't improved much because it takes me some time to learn things.
However, for some projects it took quicker times to finish it.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

These estimates made me realize that I need to finish my tasks as fast as I can but 
also maintain the code as precise and simple as it can.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

(no one has reviewed my code sadly)

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learnt that there are other methods to do certain things, either its simpler or more complex. 
Other things I learned from reviewing codes are writing docstrings under the functions/methods,
declaring constants as well as refactoring.


Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 7 Charlend's Code Feedback](https://github.com/Charlend23/cp1404practicals/pull/3#pullrequestreview-2717701560)

### Explanation

I wrote detailed yet simple comments on every code that I think needed revisions specifically. For instance,
I wrote comments to remind him to refactor some codes and to write docstrings under the method/functions.

### Good Code Review 2

[Practical 5 Sarah's Code Feedback](https://github.com/sarahaliyah/cp1404practicals/pull/1/files)

### Explanation

I wrote some alternative methods that can be done in the program like repeated tasks.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If some practicals require me to submit more than 3 files, I would reduce the question problem/ tasks

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I'm still good at submitting my practicals before the deadlines and reviewing codes.
